Cathy Dorman’s work explores light and experience in site specific domestic spaces. It challenges the viewer’s
perception, shifting between representation and abstraction. Through model making, photography, paint and
sculpture her work investigates light within space broken down into a series of planes. It experiments with
perspective, flattening space into two dimensions by disrupting its order and harmony . Through structural
contradiction, illusion and manipulation of scale, Dorman aims to transform the viewer’s awareness of their
surroundings. Her compositions obscure the autonomy of a given room whilst incorporating objects that
ground her work in reality.

<p>
    Modern architecture has altered the conventions of domestic life expanding the definition of ‘home’ by
accommodating its occupants in spaces and arrangements that reflect their activities and values. Dorman is
inspired by the role of women, both as practitioners and as patrons, in the reshaping of domestic architecture.
This current body of work focusses upon the house, Casa de Vidro in Morumbi, Sao Paulo designed by Lina
Bo Bardi in 1951.
